"""MCP tool scope configuration.

Defines which tool scopes are loaded into the MCP server. This is the
compile-time gate that enforces the Replit-lesson rule: BLOCKED tools
never participate in MCP serving, regardless of runtime flags.

Scopes
------
- read:    Safe, read-only tools. Loaded by default.
- write:   Side-effect tools (Slack, Jira, PRs). Opt-in via ``load_write``.
- blocked: Never loaded. Never surfaced in the MCP manifest. Absolute.

BLOCKED semantics
-----------------
``blocked_tool_names`` is authoritative. Any registered tool whose name
appears in this list is excluded from every ``load_scope`` result, even
``load_scope("write")``. The default list reflects the highest-risk
mutating tools the Aegis agent must never be able to invoke.
