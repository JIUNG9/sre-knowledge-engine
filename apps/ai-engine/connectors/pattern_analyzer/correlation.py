"""
Service correlation graph — which services fire alerts together.

Approach: sliding window over sorted-by-timestamp events. Two services are
"correlated" if they appear in the same window. We accumulate co-occurrence
counts, then normalise into a directional score:

    score(A->B) = co_occurrences(A,B) / firings(A)

This is asymmetric on purpose — if A always fires and B only fires when A
does, score(A->B) is 1.0 (B follows A) while score(B->A) is 1.0 too (every
B has an A nearby), but the absolute firing counts tell you the direction.

Memory-bounded: O(S^2) where S = unique services seen. Realistic S in SRE
is ~50-200 — trivial. We bound it with `max_services` and coalesce the
long tail into an "<other>" node.

    Algorithm:

        2. Maintain a deque of events whose timestamp is within
           `window_seconds` of the current event. When a new event arrives,
           pop expired entries off the left.

           currently in the window contributes a co-occurrence (X, Y).
        4. At end: firing_counts[service] = total events per service.
