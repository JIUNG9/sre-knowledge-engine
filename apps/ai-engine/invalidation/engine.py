"""Invalidation engine — Layer 1.6.

The engine fans out :class:`StateChangeEvent` from Layer 1.5 consumers
to dependent wiki pages and marks them ``pending_revalidation``.

Pattern: Truth Maintenance System (Doyle 1979). A page's claims have
*justifications* — references to external infra artifacts. When a
justification changes, every claim that depended on it becomes
suspect; a follow-up scheduler tick re-synthesizes the page.

Crash policy mirrors the rest of Aegis: an exception handling one
event is logged and the loop continues. A bad page mutation must not
abort the entire stream.
