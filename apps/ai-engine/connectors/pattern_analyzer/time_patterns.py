"""
Time-based pattern detection for incidents/alerts/logs.

All functions are pure: input is an iterable of events (anything with a
tz-aware `timestamp: datetime`), output is a plain data structure.

Naive datetimes are assumed UTC and coerced — this is stated in the
contract and tested; we don't silently guess.

Four primitives:
    day_of_week_distribution(events)   -> {weekday_int: count}   (0=Monday)
    hour_of_day_skew(events)           -> {hour: count}          (0-23, UTC)
    week_over_week_anomaly(events)     -> [TimeAnomaly]
    burst_detector(events, window_seconds, z_threshold) -> [Burst]

These are composed by `PatternAnalyzer.analyze()` but also usable standalone.
