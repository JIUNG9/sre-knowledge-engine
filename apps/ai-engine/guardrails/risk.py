"""Risk assessment — how dangerous is a proposed action?

``RiskAssessment.assess`` takes an :class:`Action` and a context dict and
returns a :class:`RiskScore` in ``[0, 100]`` plus a ladder tier cap. The
engine uses that score in two ways:

1. *Cap* the action at whatever tier the ladder says fits the score (see
   :func:`guardrails.tiers.tier_cap_for_risk`).
2. *Explain* the decision back to the operator — every score ships with a
   list of human-readable reasons so "this got downgraded to PROPOSE" is
   never opaque.

This module is intentionally small and heuristic. Real weights live in the
YAML policy so ops can tune per environment. The scorer here enforces the
floor: prod is never < dev, destructive is never < read-only, IAM/RBAC
always carries a penalty.
