"""Reverse index: ``artifact_id -> set of WikiPage slugs``.

Built once at vault load by walking every page's
:attr:`wiki.synthesizer.WikiPage.config_dependencies`. Updated
incrementally whenever the synthesizer writes a page (the
:class:`WikiEngine` calls :meth:`upsert_page` after a successful save).

We hold a single :class:`asyncio.Lock` for the whole index because
writes are rare (1-10/sec at most, when the synthesizer is busy) and
reads are tiny (one dict lookup). A more granular lock would buy
nothing and complicate reasoning about consistency.
