"""Manifest-registration tests for the Phase 2.2 FinOps tools.

Verifies the same invariants the project uses for every new
``@scoped_tool("read")`` surface:

1. Each finops tool appears in ``load_scope("read")``.
2. No finops tool appears in ``load_scope("write")`` or
   ``load_scope("blocked")`` — even when ``load_write=True``.
3. ``get_blocked()`` does not contain any finops tool name.
