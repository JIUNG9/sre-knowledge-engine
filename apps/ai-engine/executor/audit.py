"""Append-only JSONL audit log for the executor (Layer 4 / Phase 2.5).

Every executor invocation produces ONE line in the audit log — even
refusals. The line contains enough metadata to forensically reconstruct
"who tried to run what, what gate said no, what the LLM saw" without
storing raw stdout/stderr (which often contains PII or secret material).

Instead, the audit row stores SHA-256 hashes of stdout/stderr. The
operator may separately persist the raw streams under their own
retention policy and cross-reference by the hash.

The writer is process-thread-safe via a small in-memory lock. Because
each ``record()`` opens, writes one line, then closes the file, multiple
processes (e.g. uvicorn workers) can append safely on POSIX as long as
each line is below ``PIPE_BUF`` — which our records always are.
