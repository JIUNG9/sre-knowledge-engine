"""Incident investigation agent.

Uses Claude API with MCP tools to investigate incidents. The agent queries
logs, metrics, and traces, then generates a root cause analysis with
remediation proposal.

Architecture:
    1. Receives incident context (alert data, severity, affected services)
    2. Uses MCP tools to gather observability data (logs, metrics, traces)
    3. Correlates signals across data sources
    4. Generates root cause analysis with confidence scoring
    5. Proposes remediation steps with risk assessment
