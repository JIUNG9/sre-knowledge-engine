"""Public result type for one executor invocation.

``ExecutionResult`` is what the orchestrator hands back to Layer 3 (the
Control Tower) — Investigation.execution_result will carry it. Three
outcomes are possible:

* ``executed``  — the wrapped command ran (or would have run, in dry-run).
* ``refused``   — a gate (tier / approvals / kill-switch / disabled config /
                  forbidden verb) said no. ``refused_reason`` explains.
* ``failed``    — the wrapper attempted execution and the underlying
                  process raised / non-zero-exited. ``stderr`` carries the
                  wrapper's captured error stream when available.

The result is JSON-serialisable Pydantic v2 so the FastAPI router can
return it directly.
