"""Prompt-injection resistance test for the MCP scoping layer.

The threat model: an adversarial log entry, runbook snippet, or
user-supplied string contains instructions asking the agent to call
``terraform_apply`` (or any other blocked tool). A well-known LLM
failure mode is to comply.

The defence implemented by the scoping layer is structural: blocked
tools are never surfaced in the MCP manifest, so even if the model
emits a ``tool_use`` block naming ``terraform_apply``, the serving
layer cannot route it. The tool is, from the agent's perspective,
non-existent.

These tests prove that invariant.
