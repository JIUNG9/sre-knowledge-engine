"""MCP tool manifest — the single source of truth for which tools are
surfaced to the Claude agent.

Architectural principle (the "Replit lesson")
---------------------------------------------
A BLOCKED tool must be ABSENT from the MCP manifest entirely. It is not
enough to register a handler and refuse to call it — a prompt injection
can still cause the agent to invoke any tool whose schema is loaded.

The manifest enforces this at load time:

1. ``@scoped_tool("blocked")`` records the tool in ``_all_registered``
   but the manifest NEVER returns it from ``load_scope()``.
2. ``MCPScopeConfig.blocked_tool_names`` provides a second, independent
   filter — any tool name appearing there is excluded regardless of its
   registered scope (belt + suspenders).

Idempotency
-----------
Re-registering the same callable (e.g. when a package is imported twice
during testing or hot-reload) is a no-op. Re-registering a DIFFERENT
callable under an existing tool name raises ``ValueError``.
