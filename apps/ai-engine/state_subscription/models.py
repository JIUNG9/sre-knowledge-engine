"""Pydantic models for state-subscription events.

A :class:`StateChangeEvent` is the wire format every Layer 1.5 consumer
emits. Downstream the Layer 1.6 :class:`InvalidationEngine` looks events
up by ``artifact_id`` against the dependency reverse-index and marks
affected wiki pages ``pending_revalidation``.

Pattern note: this is Change Data Capture (CDC) from database-replication
literature, applied to operational knowledge. Each event is one
write-side mutation observed in an external infra subsystem.
